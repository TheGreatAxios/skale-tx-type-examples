# SKALE Tx Type Examples

After the SKALE Network v3 Pacifica rollout; type-2 transactions are now enabled on SKALE.
However, these transactions may cause the increased usage of gas.

The following code shows the difference between a type 0 and a type 2 tx.
The type2 tx on average looks to be consuming >= 2x more than the type 0 tx.
This can be resolved by overriding the gasPrice.
